My personal website. Welcome to my life!

## Summary

During my time in the first few weeks of quaratine from COVID-19, I decided to create a personal website. This website was not just to hone my skills in website development, but to also showcase my passions. In my website you'll find my personal projects, hobbies, and other works that all encompass my life in some way. For added taste, I based its theme off of Virgil Abloh's "Off-White" brand. This website will always be a work in progress!

## Stucture

This is a single-page React app slightly modified to work with GitHub pages. I chose React JS because this website will primarily be a client-side webpage, and React will allow for efficient modifications and deployment. I utilize JSON files that hold information, such as personal projects. Whenever I add any information to the JSON files, my website will dynamically render itself with the new component, eliminating the need to reformat.
