      "descriptionmain1": "College tours are great. They provide loads of information and set the first impressions of a university. But when prospective students need information about a college, the first option they go to is most likely not college tours...it will ultimately be people that have experienced that university, both good and bad. People are not afraid to voice their opinions on social media, and this can either help or hurt the college.",
      "descriptionmain2": "Readit is a website application that provides college representatives and recruiters with information about what's going around about their school. They will be able to find out what people think about everything, from the quality of education to the quality of the food on-campus. With this in mind, representatives can utilitze the positives and tackle the negatives to create a better representation of their university. Readit provides up-to-date information gathered from various social media platforms, such as Reddit. Think of it as a stock market monitoring app, but for the word around town about universities.",

      "descriptionmain1": "I'm proud to say that I have built my own personal website from scratch. Websites are great ways to only display personal projects, but also hobbies and interests so you can get to learn a little more about me. React is a powerful tool for creating clean and organized UI. I chose 'Off-White', Virgil Abloh's signature designer brand, as my main theme.",
      "descriptionmain2": "I constructed this website using React.js and modifying it to deploy through Github Pages. For the 'Projects' sections, my website dynamically renders the designs based on a JSON file. That way, if I have any new projects I can simply add it into my JSON file and the website will do the rest of the work. I personally have never taken classes on these languages/tools, so this website has been a fruitful learning experiences for me!",

      "descriptionmain1": "For our embedded-systems senior design project, our team wanted to design a system that could tackle a current problem. Mail theft has been prevalent around the country, with countless videos of passerbys swooping up packages off people's front porch. The R'Mailbox provides a safe and secure alternative for delivering packages while homeowners are out of the house.",
      "descriptionmain2": "The R'Mailbox utilizes a Raspberry Pi and ATMega1284 connected together via SPI. IR sensors detect when packages are placed inside and locks the door the moment it is shut. We implemented facial recognition and a finger print scanner to open the door. Mail services can also press a button which sends an SMS text to the user, to which he/she can unlock the door remotely. Lastly, we added AWS integration which lets users know when packages arrive and/or when the door is opened or closed.",

      "descriptionbrief": "Arduino-powered electric skateboard. Controlled with a Wii Nunchuck. Way too much fun.",
      "descriptionmain1": "As a UCR student living off-campus, I believe that a suitable method of transportation is essential. uring previous years, I have commuted to campus using various forms of transportation including bikes, skateboards, public buses, and by car, and all seem to have a downside to them. Recently, the use of rental electric vehicles have grown substantially and have impacted the way people commute. An electric skateboard would be an efficient and easy way for a student to get to campus. It maintains the size of a regular skateboard, eliminates the use for a bike lock, decreases the time it takes to get to campus, and saves the user money from gas and parking expenses.",
      "descriptionmain2": "The Tboard is an Arduino-powered electric skateboard. An Arduino is connected to the skateboard's speed controller via UART. An Arduino is connected to the skateboard's speed controller via UART. It has built-in headlights and tail lights, as well as two sensors on top of the longboard deck to detect foot placement. A built-in speaker plays specific tones upon startup and foot-sensor detection for an enjoyable user experience. A power switch and battery level indicator are built into the electronics housing. It is also controlled with a wireless Wii Nunchuk. The Tboard boasts a speed of over 20+ mph with a battery life that lasts 10-12 miles on a single charge. And in summary, the cost of this project came down to 1/5th the price of the standard Boosted Board. And most of all, it's fun!",
